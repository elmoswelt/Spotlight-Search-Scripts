Spotlight-Search-Scripts
========================

Some helper scripts to shutdown, restart etc. your machine.  

Just clone or download the files to your machine and let the system index the files. Once indexed you are able to use spotlight search (Tested on 10.10) and just execute the scripts via their names.
